To the same problems above Add \psd{-sequential} flag to
\psd{PSD\_PreProcess} for sequential solver, but remember to use
\psd{PSD\_Solve\_Seq} instead of \psd{PSD\_Solve}. So the work flow for
the 2D problem would be:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
PSD_PreProcess -dimension 2 -problem elastodynamics -dirichletconditions 1 -tractionconditions 1 \
-timediscretization newmark_beta -postprocess uav -sequential
\end{lstlisting}

Once the step above has been performed, we solve the problem using the
given mesh file \psd{bar-dynamic.msh}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
PSD_Solve_Seq -np 2 Main.edp -mesh ./../Meshes/2D/bar-dynamic.msh -v 0
\end{lstlisting}

Similarly try out the 3D problem as well.
