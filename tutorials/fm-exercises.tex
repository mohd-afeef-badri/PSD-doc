\subsection{Exercise 1}

When calculating the reaction force produced on a surface, optionally
try changing \psd{-reactionforce stress\_based} to
\psd{-reactionforce variational\_based} for changing the method to
extract reaction force, note that stress based method is way faster.

\subsection{Exercise 2}

Optionally try using \psd{-useGFP} flag with \psd{PSD\_PreProcess}
optimized solver. GFP acrynom for GoFast Plugins is a suite of C++ based
fuctions built for PSD that are speed optimal.

\subsection{Exercise 3}

Add \psd{-sequential} flag to \psd{PSD\_PreProcess} for sequential
solver, but remember to use \psd{PSD\_Solve\_Seq} instead of
\psd{PSD\_Solve}

\subsection{Advanced Exercise 1}

try the \psd{-vectorial} flag for vectorial finite element method

\subsection{Advanced Exercise 2}

try the \psd{-energydecomp} flag for using split of tensile energy

\subsection{Advanced Exercise 3}

try using \psd{-constrainHPF} flag for using the constrain condition in
hybrid phase field model
